# Airplane Go Reborn. an Awesome 3D Web Project."

> A WebGL game built with HTML, CSS, and JS, leveraging the three.js library.

## Introduction
Use the X key on the keyboard to fire bullets. Adjust the altitude of the aircraft by moving the mouse up and down to avoid the red rocks. Use the mouse left and right to adjust the camera focus of the aircraft. Pulling to the left zooms in, while pulling to the right zooms out.

I stumbled upon this project [akarsh-mahajan](https://github.com/akarsh-mahajan/3D-WebGL-Game) by chance and found it to be exactly what I was looking for in terms of framework. The technology stack is minimalistic and fits my needs perfectly. Building upon it, I've performed extensive customization, addressing numerous minor bugs, fine-tuning the scenes, and introducing additional level transitions. Moreover, I've implemented dynamic weather effects, enhancing the overall immersive experience.

For those interested, please consider following me and [akarsh-mahajan](https://github.com/akarsh-mahajan). Moving forward, I plan to enhance touchscreen support, as the current version only detects mouse input on PC. I'll also continue expanding the level design to further enrich the gameplay experience.

Your support and feedback are highly appreciated!
